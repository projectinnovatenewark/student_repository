# TODO: Section 1:
# Define a function called "double" that sets a parameter of x. It should double x and
# print that value. Call the function and pass it the below variable as an argument.
double_this = 7

# After completing the above, define a function called "printer", that sets no parameter.
# The function should just print the "double_this" variable. Call the function.

# TODO: Section 4:
# Create a function that takes a dictionary as an argument, loops through the
# dictionary, then returns the iteration number, key, and value in a readable way.
# (i.e. "iteration number 1 returns the key firstKey and the value firstValue")

# Here is an example dictionary:
EXAMPLE_DICTIONARY = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3", "key4": "value4"}

# Place the function below.
