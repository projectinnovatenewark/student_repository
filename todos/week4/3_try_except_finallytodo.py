Modify the example from week 3 lesson 3's game function
"""

# This example is from a previous lesson. We want it to ask a user how many times they want
# to play the game, play the game that many times, and tell them when they guess correctly
# along the way. One thing though- the example from the lessons doesn't account for if a user
# inputs something thats NaN (not a number). Implement a try-except-finally to address if the user
# gets a ValueError from entering a non-number.
