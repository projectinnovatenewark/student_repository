Solve the below using helper functions.
"""

# Context: Solving the problems below in one function would be kind of weird and not produce
# the prettiest code. You should break the function up into smaller, "helper" functions.

# Tip: Test your helper functions out along the way! Make sure they work on their own before trying
# to solve the whole problem in one shot.

num_list = [12, 15, 22, 13, 17, 11]

# TODO: Define a helper function called "isEven" and pass it an argument of "num".
# TODO: It should return a string indicating "is even" or "is odd".

# TODO: Define a function called "main" that sets a parameter "listy". The argument passed
# TODO: will be num_list. The main() function should iterate through these numbers and call 
# TODO: the above function and produce an output for each, formatted as: 
# TODO: "Number __ is even." or "Number __ is odd."
