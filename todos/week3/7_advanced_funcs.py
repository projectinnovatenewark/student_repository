Funcs lesson to complete these Todos"""

# TODO: You went to the store today for some food shopping and want to use a 
# TODO: funciton to add what you bought. You want to be able to reuse
# TODO: this though so you aren't sure how many arguments to use. Use *args 
# TODO: as a parameter in your shoppingList function along with store as your other parameter.
# TODO: Have your funciton print:
# TODO: "Today I went to Shoprite and bought eggs, Beyond sausage, cheese, english muffins."
# TODO: Hint: We don't want the brackets from the list in the print statement!



# TODO: The above list is great and all, but it's be great and all...
# TODO: but we don't have the costs of everything! in our new function shoppingDict,
# TODO: pass store and **bought_item as parameters and we'll want to print:
# TODO: "Today I went to shoprite and spent $22 on the following:"
# TODO: Then for every item after, print "eggs: $4" for example.
# TODO: Using the same items, eggs are $4, Beyond_sausage is $10, cheese is $3 and 
# TODO: english_muffins are $5
