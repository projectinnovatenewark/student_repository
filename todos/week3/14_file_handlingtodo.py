# IMPORTANT- BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, CD INTO THE WEEK3 FOLDER
# IN YOUR TERMINAL. THE WORKING DIRECTORY MUST BE IN WEEK3 FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK.

# Tip- while the spacing in the text file may look off, there is exactly one tab
# between every word on the lines. Text files are weird with tabs in code editors.

# For example: firstname (tab) lastname (tab) department (tab) salary (tab)

# TODO: Use the "open" function with "r" for read to open the employees.txt file

# TODO: Read each line in the text file and print them out one-by-one

# TODO: Write to the file and add in a new employee using the same format currently in use
# TODO: Reminder: the format is `firstname (tab) lastname (tab) department (tab) salary (tab)`

# TODO: Print the newly modified text file as a whole, instead of line by line.

# TODO: Once your operations are complete, make sure to use the "close" function to complete
# TODO: the todo.
