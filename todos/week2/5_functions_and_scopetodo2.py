Using helper functions
"""

# Context: solving all of the problems below in one function would be TOUGH and not produce
# the prettiest code. You should break the function up into smaller, helper functions.

# A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and
# itself. A factor is a whole number that can be divided evenly into another number.

# TODO: define a function that will take in a list of numbers as an argument. this function
# TODO: should iterate through each number in the list and return/print whether each
# TODO: number is prime. It should determine whether the number is even
# TODO: or odd as well.

num_list = [12, 15, 22, 13, 17, 11]

# TODO: Define a helper function called "isPrime" and pass it an argument of "num".
# TODO: The function should determine whether or not the number is a prime number.

# TODO: Define a helper function called "isEven" and pass it an argument of "num".
# TODO: If this function returns false, you should indicate in the "main" function
# TODO: that the number is odd.

# TODO: Finally, define a function called "main" that accepts an argument "listy". listy will be
# TODO: a list of numbers. It should iterate through these numbers and call the above functions
# TODO: and produce an output for each, formatted as "Number ___ is (even or odd) and (prime or
# TODO: not prime)." Pass this function the "num_list" argument.
