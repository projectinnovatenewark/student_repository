Enjoy your first Todo assignment! This correlates to Lesson 2, so feel free to check 
the lesson to help you thoughout the assignemnt.

# TODO: Section 1:
# Set a variable 'phrase1' equal to "Hi everyone! " and another variable 'phrase2'
# equal to "My name is ____" (complete with your name). Then use what you learned so
# far in the lesson to set these varibles to a new variable called 'complete'
# and print it.

# #########################################################################################

# TODO: Section 2:
# Set two variables in the same line, 'flt1' and 'flt2', equal to 3.5 and 14.029 respectiviely.
# Then use a print statement for each separately to check the output.

# #########################################################################################

# TODO: Section 3:
# Set a variable called name equal to your name, then set a variable of age
# equal to your age as an integer. Print a statement with an output of
# `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.` First, try doing this using
# "+" to combine your variables and the strings, then print the result.

# Takeaway:
# This should throw you a fun error, because concatenation can only be done with
# strings, not strings and integers/floats. Commas, however, simply print
# separate elements rather than attempting to concatenate strings. Comment out your 
# above code now to prevent the error from occuring as we move on.

# TODO:
# Let's use commas to print our desired output instead. Refer to the output
# above of `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.`

# #########################################################################################

# TODO: Section 4:
# Set a variable equal to each of the types we have learned so far. That includes
# integers, floats, booleans, stings, and None types. Set one variable for each
# of those types (i.e. exampleInt = 0, exampleBool = False, etc.).
# Create a print statement that would print the type of each variable you've set.

# Takeaway:
# Types are important in Python and you can check different elements' types using type().
# The type() function is an example of a polymorphic function, meaning that the same
# function name can be used for different types. BIG. WORDS. GET. YOU. JOBS. üí∞

# TODO:
# Lastly, we will introduce type conversion. There are functions you can use to
# convert things in Python. The first type conversion funciton we will use is str(). 
# Using the statement from Section 3, print `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.` 
# using concatenation (plus signs) to work with the name and age variables. Use type conversion
# to convert the variable 'age' into a string. The print statement will no longer throw an
# error üéØ since age was converted to a string.

# Takeaway:
# We can change types in Python when appropriate, and we learned one way to do so with str()

# Good job, guys! First todo down üí™üèæ
