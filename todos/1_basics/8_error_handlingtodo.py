# Uncomment any lines of code that end in a # FIXME

# Run the below to find the error. Use what you learned about error handling to find a solution.

# HINT:
# Make sure to comment out the broken code after you find it so your program can execute properly.

# TODO: Section 1.1:

# Again, run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering. Then create a solution

# spam = x * 4 # FIXME
# equation = 4 + Spam # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.2:

# Finally, run the last block of code below to find what type of error you are encountering.
# Change the code so that the mathematical operation works correctly.
