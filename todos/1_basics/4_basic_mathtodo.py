# TODO: Set a constant of `TAX_RATE` equal to .20 (we will use this as twenty percent).

# TODO: Receive a user input for the question "What is your company's name?". Set
# TODO: the input equal to a variable called `company`

# TODO: Receive a user input for the question "What was your revenue for this year?". Set
# TODO: the input equal to a variable called `revenue`

# TODO: Set a variable equal to `taxes_paid`. Calculate the taxes by multipling the rate (20%)
# TODO: from your previous variable by the revenue input from the user.

# TODO: Set a new variable called `profit`. Calculate the revenue minus the taxes paid and set it
# TODO: equal to this variable.

# TODO: Set a variable of `shareholder_payout`equal to the profit divided by 5.

# TODO: Print an output indicating "Company ____ recorded ______ dollars in revenue this year,
# TODO: paid ____dollars in taxes, recorded a profit of ______ dollars, and paid _____ dollars
# TODO: to their five shareholders, evenly".

# ! extra credit: print the remainder of the total profit divided by five using the modulo operator.
# ! The output should read "The remainder of the profit divided by 5 would be _____"
