# TODO: Section 1:
# Set the following variables and constants:
# Set a constant of `TAX_RATE` equal to .20 (we will use this as twenty percent).

# Receive a user input for the question "What is your company's name?". Set
# the input equal to a variable called `company`

# Receive a user input for the question "What was your revenue for this year?". Set
# the input equal to a variable called `revenue`

# Set a variable equal to `taxes_paid`. Calculate the taxes by multipling the rate (20%)
# from your previous variable by the revenue input from the user.

# Set a new variable called `profit`. Calculate the revenue minus the taxes paid and set it
# equal to this variable.

# Set a variable of `shareholder_payout`equal to the profit divided by 5.

# TODO: Section 1.1:
# Print an output indicating "Company ____ recorded $______  in revenue this year,
# paid $______ in taxes, recorded a profit of $______, and paid $______ to their five
# shareholders, evenly". Be sure to format to look like normal dollar amounts - "$xx.xx"

# TODO: Section 1.2:
# Print the remainder of the total profit divided by five using the modulo operator.
# ! The output should read "The remainder of the profit divided by 5 would be _____"

num_list = [35, 4, 20, 100, 96]
# Print the minimum, maximum, and sum of num_list. Then print the absolute value of the sum.

# TODO: Seciton 2.1:
num_list2 = [-20, 15, 27, -11]
# Print the absolute value of the sum of 'num_list2'
